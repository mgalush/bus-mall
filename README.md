# BusMall

BusMall is a fictitious company aimed at producing a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel which can be placed in any local bus.

Prior to production, they wanted to determine interest in potential products by creating an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups.  The appâ€™s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

The feature tasks were as follows: 
1. As a user, I would like to display three unique products by chance so that the viewers can pick a favorite.
2. As a user, I would like to track the selections made by viewers so that I can determine which products to keep for the catalog.
3. As a user, I would like to control the number of rounds a user is presented with so that I can control the voting session duration.
4. As a user, I would like to view a report of results after all rounds of voting have concluded so that I can evaluate which products were the most popular.
